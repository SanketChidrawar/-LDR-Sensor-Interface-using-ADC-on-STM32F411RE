# -LDR-Sensor-Interface-using-ADC-on-STM32F411RE
This project demonstrates how to interface an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor with the STM32F411RE microcontroller using its Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The project reads the analog signal from the LDR and converts it into a digital value, which can be used to measure ambient light intensity.
